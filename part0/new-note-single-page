### NEW NOTE SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION (SPA)

- SPA-style websites don't fetch all of their pages separately from the server like our sample application does. They have only one HTML page fetched from the server and the contents are manipulated with JavaScript that executes in the browser.

Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user goes to the single-page app version of the notes app at https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa.

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa

     Note right of browser: The Content-Type header of the request tells the server that the included data is represented in JSON format. Without this header, the server would not know how to correctly parse the data.

    activate server
    server-->>browser: The server responds with status code 201 created
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: This time the server does not ask for a redirect. The browser stays on the same page and sends no further HTTP requests.

    Note right of browser: The SPA version of the app uses the JavaScript code it got from the server originally instead of sending the form data (prevents a new GET request)
